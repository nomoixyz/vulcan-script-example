## Vulcan deployment script example

This is an example on how to use [`vulcan`]() to perform some really cool stuff.

In this example we have a [deployment script]() that deploys a contract and then automatically
imports the contract functions signatures to [samczsun's signatures database]().

## How to run the example

To execute the script run:

```
forge script script/MyContract.s.sol:DeployScript
```
